# Prediction using Supervised ML

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the "Linear Regression: Hours Studied vs. Scores" project! This repository contains a Python script that performs a simple linear regression analysis on a dataset representing the number of hours a student studies and their corresponding scores. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates a student's score based on the number of hours they dedicate to studying.

In this project, we utilize the scikit-learn library to implement a linear regression model and evaluate its performance using common regression metrics. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from a remote URL:

The analysis includes a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between hours studied and scores. Additionally, we predict the score for a hypothetical scenario where a student studies for 9.25 hours per day.
